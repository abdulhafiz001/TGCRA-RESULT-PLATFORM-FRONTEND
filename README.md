# TGCRA Result Platform Frontend

A comprehensive student result management system built with React and Laravel.

## Features

### Student Management System

The platform implements a sophisticated role-based student management system with the following permissions:

#### Admin Users
- **Full Access**: Can view, create, edit, and delete all students in the school
- **Class Management**: Can assign students to any class
- **System Administration**: Complete control over the platform

#### Form Teachers
- **Class Management**: Can view, edit, and delete students in classes where they are assigned as form teachers
- **Student Operations**: Full CRUD operations for their assigned classes
- **Limited Scope**: Cannot manage students outside their assigned classes

#### Regular Teachers
- **View Only**: Can view students in classes where they teach subjects
- **No Management**: Cannot edit, delete, or create students
- **Score Management**: Can manage scores for subjects they teach

### Key Components

#### Students.jsx
- **Role-based UI**: Different interfaces based on user permissions
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter students by class, search terms, and other criteria
- **Grid/Table Views**: Toggle between different display modes
- **Permission Indicators**: Visual indicators showing form teacher status

#### EditStudentModal.jsx
- **Comprehensive Form**: All student fields with validation
- **Role-based Access**: Only form teachers and admins can edit
- **Dynamic Class Selection**: Teachers only see their assigned classes

### API Integration

#### Backend Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/students` - Admin access to all students
- `GET /api/teacher/students` - Teacher access to assigned students
- `PUT /api/teacher/students/{id}` - Update student (form teachers only)
- `DELETE /api/teacher/students/{id}` - Delete student (form teachers only)

#### Response Structure
Teachers receive additional metadata:
```json
{
  "students": [...],
  "is_form_teacher": true,
  "form_teacher_classes": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

### Database Schema

#### Users Table
- `is_form_teacher` - Boolean flag for form teacher status
- `role` - User role (admin/teacher)

#### Classes Table
- `form_teacher_id` - Foreign key to users table for form teacher assignment

#### Teacher Subjects Table
- Links teachers to specific subjects and classes
- Determines which students a teacher can view

### Security Features

- **Role-based Middleware**: API endpoints protected by role middleware
- **Permission Validation**: Backend validates all operations against user permissions
- **Form Teacher Checks**: Ensures teachers can only manage their assigned classes
